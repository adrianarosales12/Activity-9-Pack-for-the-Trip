# Activity Description
## The Story

You're heading out on a business trip with one **8 kg carry-on bag**. You have 8 items you'd
like to bring — a laptop, a client gift, a camera, and more — each with its own weight and
usefulness score, but they don't all fit. Which combination should you pack to get the **most
total usefulness** without going over the weight limit?

This is the classic **Knapsack Problem** — the same kind of decision behind choosing which
projects to fund with a limited budget, which items to stock in limited warehouse space, or
which features to build with limited developer time. Today you'll solve it the way nature
solves survival: with a **Genetic Algorithm** — evolving a population of candidate packing plans
across generations using selection, crossover, and mutation.

This activity is a single interactive app — no coding required. Everyone in the class uses the
**same fixed items and the same fixed genetic algorithm run** (the "randomness" is seeded, so it
produces identical results every time), so your results should match your classmates' exactly.

If you'd rather run it on your own machine instead of using the shared link, see
**Running It Yourself** below.

### The App

The app has two tabs:

1. **🧳 The Packing Problem** — the 8 candidate items, the weight limit, and a glossary of
   genetic algorithm vocabulary (chromosome, gene, population, fitness, generation, selection,
   crossover, mutation) mapped onto this specific problem.
2. **🧬 Run the Genetic Algorithm** — click through 12 generations, one at a time, watching the
   population's fitness values evolve, and finally compare the algorithm's best-ever answer
   against the true optimal packing (found by checking all 256 possible combinations).

### Your Tasks

No programming background is required — just follow each step and use the hints if you get stuck.

1. **Read the Packing Problem tab.** Note the 8 items, the weight limit, and the vocabulary
   table.
   💡 *Hint:* You don't need to memorize the vocabulary — you'll see each term in action in the
   next tab.

2. **Step through all 12 generations in the Run the Genetic Algorithm tab, one click at a
   time.** Take a screenshot of Generation 1, and another of the generation where "Best-ever"
   first reaches its final value.
   💡 *Hint:* Watch the "Best in Generation" number — it doesn't always go up! That's expected:
   this is a **non-elitist** algorithm, so a good solution can disappear from the population in
   a later generation. That's exactly why "Best-ever" is tracked separately.

3. **Take a screenshot of the Final Result**, showing whether the algorithm found the true
   optimal packing.

4. **Fill out `A9_ReflectionQuestions.md`**, using the exact data from your run, and submit it
   along with your labeled screenshots.

### Running It Yourself (optional)

If you already completed Activity 2's setup and prefer to run this locally instead of using the
shared link:

```bash
conda activate ai_uam
cd Activity9
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
